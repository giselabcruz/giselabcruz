I’ve built RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, following good practices like TDD. I’ve worked with both relational databases like MySQL and SQLite, and non-relational ones like MongoDB and Neo4j.
I’ve also worked with event-driven systems using message brokers.

While backend is my main thing, I’ve also built some frontend with React and Vite, using JavaScript and TypeScript.

I care about clean code and good architecture.
I’m currently practicing TDD with katas in C#, a language I’m enjoying learning as part of the .NET ecosystem.

I use Docker to keep my environments clean and consistent.
For planning, I like using Kanban boards to stay organized and track progress.

Lately, I’ve been diving into Model-Context Protocol. I find it fascinating how it connects tools, code, and AI in a practical way.

So, yes, sometimes I code.
