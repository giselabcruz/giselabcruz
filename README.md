## ðŸŒ¿ Welcome!

I like building RESTful APIs, following good practices like TDD, and working with tools like Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.

Currently learning .NET with C# and also getting more into the Cloud world.

So, yes, sometimes I code. And sometimes I read error messages like horoscopes.
