# ðŸŒ¿ Welcome!

Iâ€™ve built RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, following good practices like TDD. Iâ€™ve worked with both relational databases like MySQL and SQLite, and non-relational ones like MongoDB and Neo4j.
Iâ€™ve also worked with event-driven systems using message brokers.

While backend is my main thing, Iâ€™ve also built some frontend with React Native and Vite, using JavaScript and TypeScript.

I care about clean code and good architecture.
Iâ€™m currently practicing DDD with katas in C#, a language Iâ€™m enjoying learning as part of the .NET ecosystem.

I use Docker to keep my environments clean and consistent.
For planning, I like using Kanban boards to stay organized and track progress.

So, yes, sometimes I code.
